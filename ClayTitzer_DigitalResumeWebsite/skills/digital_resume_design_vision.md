# Digital Resume Portfolio – Design Vision

---

# 1. Design Objective

Create a minimal, structured, technically credible portfolio that:

- Reflects senior-level automation engineering discipline
- Subtly incorporates workflow/orchestration visual language
- Avoids visual clichés (robots, circuit boards, stock "AI" imagery)
- Feels intentional, engineered, and handcrafted
- Uses animation as reinforcement — not decoration

Tone: **Deliberate. Structured. Precise. Controlled.**

---

# 2. Core Aesthetic Principles

## Minimalism With Structure

- Generous whitespace
- Strong typographic hierarchy
- Grid-aligned layout
- Limited color palette (charcoal, off-white, slate, muted blue accent)
- No gradients, no glassmorphism, no trendy UI effects

Design should feel engineered — not styled.

## Typography-Driven Identity

- Large, confident heading typography
- Clear section delineation
- Subtle use of mono-spaced font for technical metadata (dates, stack tags, sync timestamps)

Example use cases:
- "Last Synced: 2026-02-14"
- "Automation | Orchestration | Integration"

---

# 3. Subtle RPA-Themed Visual Language

Do NOT use:
- Robot imagery
- AI brain visuals
- Circuit backgrounds
- Futuristic chrome UI

Instead, incorporate subtle references to workflow systems:

### A. Structural Motifs

- Vertical timeline connectors resembling workflow paths
- Thin connector lines between sections (like process flows)
- Node-style bullet indicators (minimal dots with subtle hover expansion)

### B. Micro-Details

- Section dividers styled like execution boundaries
- Hover state labels such as:
  - "Trigger"
  - "Process"
  - "Output"
- Subtle dotted connectors between related content blocks

### C. Animation Language

Animations should mimic workflow execution:

- Sequential fade-ins (step-by-step reveal)
- Slight delay between content blocks (like activity execution)
- Scroll-triggered transitions that feel deterministic, not playful

Avoid:
- Bouncy easing
- Overshoot animations
- Excessive motion

Motion curve: ease-in-out, restrained, 150–300ms

# 4. Homepage (Hero + Scroll Narrative)

## Layout Structure

Above the fold:

- Name (large typography)
- Title: "RPA Developer II"
- One-line positioning statement
- Headshot (clean, professional, neutral background)

Below hero (scroll-revealed):

Section 1 – Most Recent Experience
- Company
- Role
- Dates
- 3–5 achievement bullets

Section 2 – Education
- Institution
- Degree
- Dates

### Scroll Behavior

As the user scrolls:

- Content reveals in sequence
- Vertical line subtly extends downward as sections appear
- Sections anchor cleanly without parallax gimmicks

Goal: It should feel like a process being executed top-to-bottom.

---

# 5. About Page

Purpose: Provide narrative depth without losing technical tone.

Content Structure:

1. Short bio (concise, impact-focused)
2. Philosophy section
   - Automation as leverage
   - Clean systems over complexity
3. Technical focus areas
   - UiPath
   - C#
   - Workflow architecture
   - Integration systems

Optional subtle detail:
- Small “System Principles” block styled like documentation notes

---

# 6. LinkedIn Feed Integration

## Placement Options

Option A – Dedicated "Insights" Page
Option B – Section at bottom of homepage

Recommended: Dedicated page for architectural clarity.

## Design Requirements

- Card-based layout
- Clean borders
- No shadow-heavy design
- Headshot anchored top-left of feed page
- "Last Synced" timestamp displayed in mono font

Post structure:
- Post content
- Date
- Engagement metrics (minimal visual emphasis)

Avoid social-media styling mimicry.
It should feel like archived professional output — not a feed clone.

---

# 7. Animation Guidelines

Animations must:

- Reinforce hierarchy
- Indicate structure
- Guide reading flow
- Never distract

Examples:

- Section fade-in with slight upward motion (8–12px)
- Timeline connector line animates downward as user scrolls
- Hover states subtly increase line thickness or opacity

Avoid:
- Infinite loops
- Decorative particle effects
- Heavy parallax

---

# 8. Anti-AI-Generated Safeguards

To prevent generic template appearance:

- Use asymmetrical spacing (intentional, not chaotic)
- Avoid stock illustration libraries
- Write copy in your own voice (no buzzword stacking)
- Keep component count low
- Prioritize layout clarity over visual density

The site should feel engineered — not decorated.

---

# 9. Visual Identity Summary

| Element | Guiding Principle |
|----------|-------------------|
| Layout | Structured, grid-aligned |
| Motion | Sequential, deterministic |
| Color | Neutral with controlled accent |
| Imagery | Minimal, professional headshot only |
| Theme | Workflow-inspired, not robotic |
| Tone | Senior engineer, not startup marketer |

---

# 10. Overall Experience Goal

When someone visits the site, they should think:

- "This person builds systems."
- "This feels intentional."
- "There is structure behind this."
- "This reflects automation thinking without being obvious."

The design should embody automation discipline without ever explicitly showing automation graphics.
